LIMITED WARRANTY 

Wolf Games LLC warrants to the original consumer purchaser of the Game Software that the recording medium on which the Game Software is recorded shall be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from the original date of purchase (the "Limited Warranty"). If a defect covered by the Limited Warranty occurs during this ninety (90) day period, the defective Game Software shall be replaced by the retailer from which you purchased the Game Software, free of charge.  Please retain the original or a photocopy of your dated sales receipt to establish the date of purchase for in-warranty replacement. For replacement, return the product, with its original packaging and receipt, to the retailer from which the software was originally purchased. In the event that you cannot obtain a replacement from the retailer, please contact Wolf Games LLC to obtain support.

The provisions of the Limited Warranty are valid in the United States and Canada only. 

Any applicable implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, are hereby limited to ninety (90) days from the date of purchase of the Game Software, and are subject to the conditions set forth herein. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion of consequential or incidental damages, and in such states and jurisdictions, Wolf Games LLC�s and its licensors� liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other rights that vary from state-to-state or from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction. 

LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES

The Limited Warranty does not apply if the defects have been caused by your negligence, accident, unreasonable use, modification, tampering, or any other causes not related to defective materials or manufacturing workmanship, and Wolf Games LLC and its licensors shall not be held liable for any damage, injury or loss if caused as a result of any of these reasons.  However, Wolf Games LLC and its licensors do not seek to exclude or limit their liability for personal injury arising from their negligence. The Limited Warranty does not apply to used Game Software or to Game Software acquired through private transactions between individuals or purchased from online auction sites.

In no event shall Wolf Games LLC or its licensors be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from possession, use or malfunction of the Game Software, including without limitation the risks connected with lost profit, damage to property, lost data, loss of goodwill, console, computer or handheld device failure, errors and lost business or other information as a result of possession, use or malfunction of the Game Software, or personal injuries, even if Wolf Games LLC has been advised of the possibility of such loss or damages. Furthermore, in no event shall Wolf Games LLC or its licensors be liable for consequential or incidental damages resulting from the breach of any express or implied warranties. Wolf Games LLC's total liability shall not exceed the actual price paid for the Game Software.    

TERMINATION

Without prejudice to any other rights of Wolf Games LLC, this License shall terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions.  In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Game Software.

INJUNCTION

Because Wolf Games LLC would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that Wolf Games LLC shall be entitled, without bond or other security or proof of damages, to take such action as may be required, including seeking an injunction and other equitable remedies, in addition to any other remedies available to it under the applicable law. 

INDEMNITY

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Wolf Games LLC, its partners, affiliates, contractors, licensors, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including legal expenses) arising directly or indirectly from your acts or omissions to act in using the Game Software pursuant to the terms of this License.

MISCELLANEOUS

This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and Wolf Games LLC concerning the License, in relation to the use of the Game Software, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations, warranties or understandings between you and Wolf Games LLC (whether negligently or innocently made but excluding those made fraudulently), regarding the same subject matter.  Wolf Games LLC reserves the right to amend this Agreement at any time, at its sole discretion. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and not be affected.
